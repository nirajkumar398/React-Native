This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

üöÄ Simplified Guide: Why a Well-Organized Project Folder Matters in React and React Native! üåü

In the world of coding, imagine the project folder structure as your own treasure map! üó∫Ô∏èü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

üéØ Why does it matter?

üåê Easy Navigation: Picture a well-arranged bookshelf; a good folder structure helps developers swiftly locate files and resources. It's like a clear roadmap making coding easier and faster.

üõ† Manage & Expand: Like building blocks, a neat structure allows us to add new rooms (code, components) to our house (project) easily. As our project grows, a good structure keeps things tidy and avoids confusion.

üß© Reuse & Share: Just like Lego bricks, organized folders make it easy to reuse components and share them across the project. It's like using your favorite toy bricks to build different things!

üíº Teamwork: For group projects, a structured folder system is like having a common language. It makes teamwork smoother by helping everyone find their way around the code.

üåü The Folder Blueprint:

Components & Screens: Keep UI parts separate and organized.
Services & Utilities: Store important functions and services.
Redux & Navigation: House state management and navigation info.
Assets & Constants: Store images, icons, audio, and important values.
